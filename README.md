## The (RE)SOURCES RELATIONNELLES project

### Project contributions workflow

Each developer must create a branch for the feature he is currently developping.

No one should commit directly to the branch `main`. To push code on `main`, you
must do a merge request (also called "pull request" on Github).

### Backend
    You need `.env`
#### With npm

Use the terminal commande `npm install` to install the dependencies and use `nodemon` to start the server and API system.

#### Swagger
